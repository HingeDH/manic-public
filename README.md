__Current pack version:__ `v0.3.4`

Bored of the current phantoms? Want a new game mechanic? Want something spookier to spice up your Minecraft world? Manic simultaneously reworks the phantom system while attempting to provide a scary, innovative and challenging gameplay mechanic involving Sanity. Manic also provides new tech, tools, and items themed around Sanity.
Manic is compatible in both 1.18 and 1.19 snapshots. It may show errors on loading in 1.19, but it should work the same.

# üëÅÔ∏è About üëÅÔ∏è
In short, Manic adds Sanity. Sanity is decreased by staying in the dark, sleepless nights, being in deep caves, and more, while it's increased by sleeping, eating healthy, being around pets, and more. At low levels of Sanity, the eyeball above your bar will open, and at even lower levels, it'll turn Green - this means you're in danger of Phantoms and their newfound friends spawning. But it isn't all bad; low levels of Sanity may even prove beneficial at times.

Manic also adds new tech content: for example, the Corpsebloom is a new plant that kills undead monsters for the player and produces Sanity in the form of Corpse Sap, which can be stored by its cousin, the Corpsegourd, or turned into new recipes and tools called Anirrum and Charonite with the Corpsepitcher. Oh, did I mention that Manic adds cheese?<hr/>

    ‚è∞Compatibility Notice‚è∞
  </summary>
  Manic tries very hard to be compatible with other packs but you may encounter some issues.<br/><br/>

  __Actionbar Display__<br/>
  Manic may conflict with other packs that use the actionbar. Packs can set the objective `manic.hide_sanity` to a value to hide the Sanity bar for that amount of ticks. It currently has compatibility with The Creeper's Code's tea.<br/><br/>

  __Unlock All Recipes__<br/>
  Manic is not compatible with Unlock All Recipes packs. If you wish to unlock all recipes, use the command:<br/>
  `/advancement grant @s through minecraft:recipes/root`<br/><br/>

  __Teams__<br/>
  Teams may cause slight issues. Manic has built in compatibility with [Smithed](https://smithed.dev).
